# BlockHorizons Code Style
BlockHorizons' default code style for most repositories to import in PHPStorm

### The basics
* Tabs must be used instead of spaces
* Tabs must have an indendation size of 4
* PHPDoc comments should have a space between every tag type, e.g.
```php
/**
 * Some method.
 * 
 * @param string $parameter
 *
 * @return bool
 */
```
* YAML files should start with `---` and end with `...`, and a space between the text and comment hashtag, e.g.
```yaml
---
# A comment
some-key: something
...
```
